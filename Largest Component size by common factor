// Approach 1 - by graph 
in this edge will be between only those two who contain a common factor and so we have to find the maximum size of the component
-> first we will use N^2 loop to build a graph by using some traversal 
-> then some time will also get used up in knowing the max size of the component.
So it will take a hell lot of time for higher nodes.

// Approach 2 -> Union/Disjoint sets
